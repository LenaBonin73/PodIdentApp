# PodIndentApp
Repository of the PodIndent app

PodIndent app is a R shiny application made to visualize, explore and compare data from different studies about podocytes. <br>
## The user can :
1) Compare data, in this case he has 3 possibilities : 
  - Compare them using percentiles : in this case a barcode plot is displayed for each gene under study. There should be one vertical line per dataset in which the gene is found. However, all lines might not be vizible without zooming in.
  - Compare them using normalized fold-change and vizualize it using lollipop plot : in this case there is one plot per gene under study. 
  - Compare them using normalized fold-change and vizualize it using a heatmap : the closer to 1 the more red, the closer to -1 the more blue. 0 is grey and missing value wight. In order for the heatmap to be displayed, at least two genes are necessary. 

2) Plot a gene set enrichment analysis : 
The user can select one or more keyword(s) he wants to study and one or more dataset. Then an enrichment plot for each combination keyword/dataset is displayed. This plot is computed using the fgsea package (Korotkevich G, Sukhov V, Sergushichev A (2019). “Fast gene set enrichment analysis.” bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/060012, http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/20/060012.)

3) Download the datasets : 
The user can select one dataset to download as CSV, in this case, in addition the first 10 rows of the dataset are displayed in the application. It is also possible to dowload directly all datasets as CSV, in that case they are downloaded in a zip file. 

## Datasets
<strong> Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of the Kidney Glomerulus Identifies Key Cell Types and Reactions to Injury (Chung) : </strong> <br>
Single-cell transcriptome of the glomerulus in healthy and injured-model mice.
Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on glomeruli from healthy mice and from four different disease models, nephrotoxic serum nephritis, diabetes, doxorubicin toxicity, and CD2AP deficiency. C57BL/6J and BTBR ob/ob (BTBR.Cg-Lepob/WiscJ) mice were used. Single-cell data were processed and further analyzed by Partek Flow software (version 8.0.19.0707).<br>

<strong> Molecular fingerprinting of the podocyte reveals novel gene and protein regulatory networks (Boerries transcriptome) : </strong> <br>
The transcriptome of mouse podocytes.
Transcriptomic profiling of podocytes and non-podocytes were generated by Affymetrix WT Mouse Gene ST 1.0. miRNA expression profiling was acquired through ArrayStar. Podocytes and non-podocytes were isolated by FACS sorting. Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J × hNPHS2Cre mice were used. Statistical analysis of transcriptomic and miRNA data was performed with R. <br>

<strong> Genome-Wide Analysis of Wilms’ Tumor 1-Controlled Gene Expression in Podocytes Reveals Key Regulatory Mechanisms (Kann) : </strong> <br>
The transcriptome of mouse podocytes.
CHIP-seq data were acquired from pooled samples of 6 CD-1 wild-type mice using an anti-WT1 (Wilm’s tumor suppressor 1) antibody. GFP labeled podocytes from Nphs2-Cre and R26-mTmG hybrid mice were isolated by FACS and were subject to RNA sequencing. Data were mapped through Eland and Bowtie. <br>

## Percentiles
For each gene in each dataset, we compute its percentile of absolute quantification. That is to say, percentile correspond to the percentage of genes in the same dataset that have an absolute quantification smaller or equal to the absolute quantification of the gene under study.

## Normalized fold-changes
In order to be able to compare all datasets together we decided to use the relative quantification variable. However, these variables differed a lot between the datasets in their amplitude. Thus, we decided to normalize them in order to get a number between -1 and 1, where -1 means completely under expressed and 1 over expressed in that dataset. <br>
To do that, we used the fact that for a normal distribution, 99.7 % of the data lie between mean - 3 sd and mean + 3 sd. For each gene, if its absolute quantification was less than the lower bound, then its normalized fold-change was set to -1, if it was greater than the upper bound, its normalized fold-change was set to 1. Otherwise, the normalized fold-change was computed as <br>
-1 + (relative quanti - lower-bound)*2 /
